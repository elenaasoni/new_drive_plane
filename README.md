## General Introduction

In the last ten years the little city of Lugano  began to show some traffic problems. In order to improve the circulation a new drive plane was introduced. 
The project was quite revolutionary, a new tunnel (Vedeggio-Cassarate)  was built  and   some important access way have been closed in one direction in order to get a stronger, unidirectional traffic flow. Despite that fact, many people don’t appreciate this change for the following reasons.

## Fundamental Questions

The new traffic plane is really better? In particular:
How is the expected drive time changed?
How is the expected time using public transports changed?
Is the new traffic plane good or bad conditioned?
What about the ecological impact? 
What kind of consequences will it have on vendors?
