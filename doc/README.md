THE NEW DRIVE PLANE OF LUGANO	

In Brief

In the last ten years the little city of Lugano began to show some traffic problems. In order to improve the circulation a new drive plane was introduced. 
The project was quite revolutionary, a new tunnel (Vedeggio-Cassarate) was built and   some important access way have been closed in one direction in order to get a stronger, unidirectional traffic flow. Despite that fact, many people don’t appreciate this change for the following reasons.

Focus area

We want to compare the new traffic plane with the old one, in particular we’ll run MATLAB simulations focusing on following aspects:
 	Expected drive time
 	Expected time using public transports
 	Stability of the two drive plane
 	Traffic risk
 	Economical consequences for vendors in the center of the city
 	Ecological impact
 	(If we have enough time) Extension and possible prevision for the future.

Details

Firstly, we want to compare the expected time on the first and the second TP, we’ll run simulations on a considerable category of drivers like shop employers, lawyer, students, tourist, … introducing random effects, like collision, broken lighter, rain and snow.
In a second part we simulate the stability of the old and the new plane. With stability we mean that the traffic net tolerate some random effects without crash. A third part will focuses about economical and ecological differences.
Once more, we’d like to investigate (if we’d enough time) about the possible behavior of a driver. In the lecture algorithms and complexity are seeing some interesting algorithms (Dijnkstra, Floyd-Warshall, Prim …) that we think it could be very helpful tools in understanding the dynamical disposition of traffic.
For instance: If an employer (BOB) is driving to work (X) on the shortest way A, listening to the radio and the speaker says that there are problems on A, B, C that are the only possible ways to X, what will BOB do?
If possible, we’d like to write the paper in LaTeX in order to learn it,  that will also depend on the size of the mathematical/theoretical part.
